### Built with

### What I learned

I learned how to use flexbox and CSS grid by myself. I've been watching youtube tutorials and following Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp (I highly recommend it if you're trying to learn web development) and thought this would challenge me to learn.

 This challenge helped me understand more CSS properties like box-shadow, adding an overlay to an image, creating a layout with CSS grid. I actually really enjoyed myselft in this challenge.
